# Satisclient
This is the repo with the solution of the Satispay exercise.

## Usage
You can clone the repo and open the project with eclipse in order to build and launch the program.
Otherwise you can just download the release and launch the Satispay.jar in this way:
    `java -jar Satisclient.jar [method]`
Where method can be `get`, `post`, `put`, `delete`. If you don't specify a method or specify a method that isn't supported by this client will be used the method `get`.
